## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Node.js
- Java 21
- PostgreSQL (optional for local setup)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo/backend
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create an `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following:
   ```
   DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<NEON_DB_URL>
   DB_USERNAME=<YOUR_DB_USERNAME>
   DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
   JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t fullstack-backend .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env fullstack-backend
   ```

4. Test the API:
   Visit `http://localhost:8080/api/` in your browser or API testing tool (e.g., Postman).

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Ensure your Dockerfile is set up correctly in the `backend` directory.
2. Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or Renderâ€™s registry).
3. Set up a new service in Render and configure environment variables.

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify)
1. Link your repository to a Netlify project.
2. Set the build command to:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Configure the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in Netlify.
4. Deploy your site.
